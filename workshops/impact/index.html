    <h2 id="our-participants">Our participants</h2>
<p>Over 500 people have attended a CodeRefinery workshop since the project
started! Our workshop participants range from undergraduate students to full
professors, and come from a variety of academic disciplines. The two charts
below show academic position and discipline of workshop participants.</p>
<p><img src="/workshops/disciplines_positions.png" alt="alt text" title="A
pie chart on the left-hand side shows break downs of participants' disciplines.
24% has physical sciences, 22% computer and information sciences, 13%
biological sciences, 11% engineering sciences. Otherwise small portions, less
than 10%, of each. A pie chart on the right-hand side shows break downs of
academic positions of the participants. 49% graduate students, 18% postdocs,
14% researchers, and others are less than 10% for each" /></p>
<h2 id="what-is-our-impact">What is our impact?</h2>
<p>The long-term impact of CodeRefinery workshops is measured through a
post-workshop survey which is sent out to all former participants 3-6 months
after attending a workshop. The two graphs below show how former participants
use various software development tools after attending a workshop (left), and
how their code and collaboration with colleagues has changed (right). These
results are based on 92 survey responses obtained to date.</p>
<p><img src="/workshops/heatmap_yesno.png" alt="alt text" title="A bar chart
on the left-hand side shows that the majority showed their satisfaction of the
workshops as they felt that it made it easier to collaborate on software
development, that their code became more reusable, and more reproducible. A
matrix chart on the right-hand side shows break downs of participants' adoption
of best practices depending on the extent and the types of the best practices" /></p>
<h2 id="what-do-our-participants-say-after-attending-a-workshop">What do our participants say after attending a workshop?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm more conscious about the way I write programs and organize their
'organic' growth. I try to modularize more and write proper tests. I also use
git more extensive to keep track about my different development branches&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The main thing I got out of the workshop is that I'm now extensively using
the issue-tracking systems on GitHub and GitLab. Also on one of my major
projects we have moved towards having shorter lived feature branches and
using merge requests for more frequent merges and less code divergence. I
also started using GitLab's issues system more frequently. It made it easier
for people in my lab to report bugs, and easier for me to keep track of them&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My code became much more 'sustainable' in the sense for others to
read/use/modify it. In detail the most significant is improved use of git
(forking workflow) and more strict 'purity' of functions. Use of PyCharm
increased speed of development&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I take more time to think about long term solutions than 'quick fixes' even
if it's short of time. Another aspect is that I try to make the code
reproducible in the sense of documentation, code readability, clear log
files, etc, both for helping myself and my collaborators&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My code is better documented, and I use version control much more. I have
also started writing more unit tests&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I write my codes now in such a way that the person who will be taking over
my job would have less time figuring out what is going on. The emphasis of
writing modular codes in the workshop was very helpful for me and for the
people using my code&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For me the most important thing was to learn to use git better. Now I make
frequent commented commits so it is far easier to see what I actually did for
me and others too&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This was an extremely useful workshop. Thank you very much! I wish I had
known this stuff already as a grad student 10+ years ago. It is now easier to
collaborate with co-developers and easier to keep things in order and
structured&quot;</p>
